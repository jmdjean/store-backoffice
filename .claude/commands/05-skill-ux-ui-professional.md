# SKILL - UX/UI for Online Store (Angular 21)

## Objective
Ensure professional, consistent, and accessible frontend screens with reusable components and clear user feedback.

> Project language rule:
> - Code and technical comments in English
> - User-facing text/messages in Portuguese (Brazil)

## 1) Required UX pillars
### 1.1 Clarity
Users should quickly understand where they are, what they can do, and what just happened.

### 1.2 Consistency
Keep spacing, typography, forms, buttons, icons, and visual hierarchy consistent.

### 1.3 Efficiency
Reduce clicks/typing and keep common actions visible.

### 1.4 Accessibility
Keyboard navigation, visible focus, sufficient contrast, and semantic cues.

---

## 2) UI standards
- Define and reuse design tokens.
- Prefer reusable components (`PageHeader`, `DataGrid`, `EmptyState`, `StatusBadge`, `ConfirmDialog`).
- Always implement loading/empty/error states.

### pt-BR user message examples
- "Não foi possível carregar os dados. Tente novamente."
- "Sua sessão expirou. Faça login novamente."
- "Campo obrigatório."

---

## 3) Forms and grids
- Keep labels explicit.
- Validate after interaction or submit.
- Disable submit while saving.
- Use semantic badges for statuses.

## Completion checklist
- [ ] Layout and components are consistent
- [ ] Required states implemented
- [ ] Basic a11y covered
- [ ] User-facing text in pt-BR
